No distortion whatsoever in Sound drum.SD is winner.Bass: Rugby has thunderous bass. Sound drum has concentrated bass which you can feel easily.SD is winner.Size: Sound drum is very compact and portable. Extra bucks is worth for it's size. Rugby is heavy and less portable.SD is winner.Build: Both are equally rigid and robust in design.Tie.Design: Rugby is covered with metal mesh & rubberized along the edge. Sound drum is covered with fabric on the outer & plastic inside.

Hoshiyar Yadav,Perfect product!,5,"If you are looking for a speaker which is compact and have mind blowing bass and too clear sound reproduction, I suggest you to blindly go for this.I have used Soundbot SB571, but they are not water/dust proof and stand nowhere in terms of bass.Pros-1. Clarity and Purity of Sound2. Good balance between bass and treble3. Whenever required produces awesome bass4. Water and Dust proof5. Too compact and light weight6. Almost all type of ports available for connectivity, more than any other product7. Battery life is more than what they are claiming"
