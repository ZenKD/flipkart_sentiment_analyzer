## üìñ Abstract

This project presents a web-based sentiment analysis tool designed to extract, analyze, and visualize customer opinions from Flipkart product reviews. The system combines web scraping techniques with natural language processing to provide actionable insights into customer sentiment. By automating the review analysis process, the tool helps users make informed purchasing decisions and assists businesses in understanding customer feedback at scale.

The application utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup for data extraction, NLTK's VADER for sentiment analysis, and Flask for the web interface. The system processes both textual content and numerical ratings to generate a comprehensive sentiment score, identifying positive, neutral, and negative opinions. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide an intuitive understanding of overall product reception and highlight key themes in customer feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture:

1.  **Scraper Module:** Handles URL processing, web navigation (using Selenium), and data extraction (using BeautifulSoup) from Flipkart product pages.
2.  **Analyzer Module:** Processes extracted review text and ratings. This includes text preprocessing (emoji conversion, special character removal), sentiment scoring with VADER, rating normalization, and combining scores. It also handles keyword extraction.
3.  **Web Application (Flask):** Manages user interaction (URL input), orchestrates the scraping and analysis process, generates visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn, and presents the results on a web interface. It also handles data export.

**Data Flow:**
1.  User submits a Flipkart product URL via the web interface.
2.  The Scraper Module extracts reviews.
3.  The Analyzer Module processes these reviews to generate sentiment scores and insights.
4.  The Web Application displays these insights through statistics, visualizations, and sample reviews.
5.  User can download the analyzed data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flipkart-review-sentiment-analyzer.git
    cd flipkart-review-sentiment-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, create one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing packages manually.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    dependencies include: `flask`, `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `nltk`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests` (often used with BeautifulSoup).

4.  **Download NLTK resources (VADER lexicon):**
    Run Python and execute:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
    # You might also need 'stopwords' if you are using it for keyword extraction
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

5.  **Setup WebDriver:**
    Selenium requires a WebDriver to interface with the chosen browser.
    *   Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox).
    *   Ensure the WebDriver executable is in your system's PATH or specify its path in your Selenium configuration within the code.
    *   Example: If using Chrome, download ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Ensure all dependencies and NLTK resources are installed and WebDriver is set up.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    (Or whatever your main Flask script is named).
4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in your terminal).
5.  Enter a Flipkart product URL into the input form and submit to see the sentiment analysis.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology Highlights

*   **Web Scraping:**
    *   **Dynamic Content Handling:** Selenium WebDriver clicks "READ MORE" buttons to fetch full review text.
    *   **Robust Parsing:** BeautifulSoup extracts customer names, review titles, star ratings, and comments.
    *   **Pagination:** Scraper iterates through multiple review pages.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:**
    *   **Preprocessing:** Emoji conversion, special character removal, lowercasing.
    *   **VADER Scoring:** Generates compound sentiment scores (-1 to +1).
    *   **Rating Integration:** `Sentiment_Score = 0.7 * Text_Score + 0.3 * Rating_Normalized`
    *   **Classification:** Positive, neutral, or negative, with special handling for 3-star reviews.
    *   **Keyword Extraction:** Identifies frequent terms in positive/negative reviews after stop word removal.

## üöß Limitations and Challenges

1.  **Web Scraping Reliability:** The scraper is dependent on Flipkart's HTML structure and may break if the website's design changes.
2.  **Language Limitations:** Currently optimized for English reviews.
3.  **Contextual Understanding:** VADER may not capture complex nuances like sarcasm or deep context.
4.  **Processing Time:** Scraping and analyzing a large number of reviews can be time-consuming.
5.  **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Flipkart might implement more robust anti-scraping techniques that could block the scraper.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

*   Implement more robust error handling and logging for the scraper.
*   Add support for multiple languages.
*   Explore more advanced NLP models (e.g., transformer-based models like BERT) for better contextual understanding.
*   Optimize scraping speed (e.g., using asynchronous requests or distributed scraping).
*   Develop strategies to handle CAPTCHAs or other anti-scraping measures.
*   Add user accounts and history of analyzed products.
